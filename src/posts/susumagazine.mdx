SUSU Credit Union Magazine is a personal finance publication with a special focus on non-bank institutions and small businesses.

After producing printed magazines annually for 6 years, they wanted to reinvent their digital presence by hosting their magazines digitally.

## Why build SUSU?

My parents started SUSU back in 2013 - it was a dream that they had to run a publication that would highlight the good that Credit Unions contribute to Caribbean societies.

As I now had the power to enhance the work they have been doing for so long, it was my absolute pleasure to design and build this website for them.

## Challenge: Magazine Library

SUSU needed to provide access to flipbooks of the current and previous versions of the magazine.

I needed to find a way to give users access to the flipbooks, will displaying the most important information about the magazine issue on the main website.

## What Did I Learn?

This website pushed me to take two short courses:

- [CSS Grids and Flexbox](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-grids-flexbox/) - FrontendMasters
- [Grids and Responsive Design](https://www.udemy.com/course/grids-responsive-design-uxui-design/?src=sac&kw=grids+%26+responsive+design) - Udemy
