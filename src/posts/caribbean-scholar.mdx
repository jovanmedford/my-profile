Caribbean Scholar is an education company that is dedicated towards delivering a high quality online
learning experience for West Indian students.

## Why Caribbean Scholar?

I'm definitely an online course superfan. I love education and learning new things - especially in a
self-driven environment. As person who'd been taking online courses for a number of years, it was a
natural progression for me to want to teach one. I looked around my skillset for something I could
comfortably teach on at the time and I settled on High School Math.

I used Thinkific as my choice of LMS but I built on some landing pages and a [blog](https://www.thecaribbeanscholar.com/blog/).
My favourite part of the site is an exam schedule app that I built using Netlify functions to
perform CRUD operations.

## Challenge: Exam Schedule App

Students taking CXC exams sometimes get confused about their schedule and might even miss an exam completely.
This happens more often than it should - so I thought it would be a neat addition to the site to make
an app that lets students check exam dates and see a countdown to their exam.

### Reusbale Form

The first challenge was to build a reusable form hook that would help me to quickly build forms
whenever necessary. The hook takes in an object with configuration deatails for each input in the form. The
inputs, state and event handlers are set up within the hook, saving us lots of repetitive work.
The connected inputs, state and submission function are then returned to be implemented in the form instance.
The main concept here is [closure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) which allows us to access
the lexical environment from the useForm hook without having to go over the boring parts.

### Student View

Each CXC exam comes with up to 2 or 3 papers.

To give students quick access to their exam dates, the app allows them to filter by subject name and level.
They can then cycle through the specific papers using the arrows and switch to the countdown view when they
prefer.

### Exam Manager View

Using the useForm hook it was easy to create a form for submitting exam data to the fauna db database.
Administrators can submit new exam data using this form. Authentication will be added before the app
goes live.

## What Did I Learn?

This project is growing along with me - I still have so many ideas for new features
and loads of refactoring to catch up on. Below are just a few of the key resources I used while
building it up to where it is now.
