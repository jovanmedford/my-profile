Hello Hello! I'm Jovan, a developer that likes to build things that work - sometimes...No really! I enjoy designing and building beatiful web apps.

Over the past year I worked on my passion project [Caribbean Scholar](https://www.thecaribbeanscholar.com/). I'm uber excited to see how it'll grow with my developer journey over the years.
